## **Project Workflow**

### **1. Kickoff & Stakeholder Questions**
The project began with a detailed kickoff session to gather requirements:
- What are the **key objectives** of the dashboard?  
- Who will **use the dashboard** and for what purpose?  
- What are the expected **deliverables** and timelines?  
- Are there specific **design preferences**?  

### **2. Data Understanding**
The dataset consisted of:  
- **Dimension Tables**: Customer, Market, Product.  
- **Fact Tables**: Monthly sales, monthly forecasts, and costs.  

### **3. Data Modeling**
- Used a **snowflake schema** for performance optimization.  
- Established proper relationships and hierarchies to support diverse analyses.
