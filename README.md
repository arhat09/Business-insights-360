Project Workflow
1. Kickoff & Stakeholder Questions
Before starting the project, a detailed kickoff session was held to gather requirements:

What are the key objectives of the dashboard?
Who will use the dashboard and for what purpose?
What are the expected deliverables and timelines?
Are there specific design preferences?
2. Data Understanding
The dataset consisted of:

Dimension Tables: Customer, Market, Product.
Fact Tables: Monthly sales, monthly forecasts, and costs.
3. Data Modeling
The Snowflake schema was used for optimal performance. Proper relationships and hierarchies were defined to support various analyses.

4. Dashboard Design
Each department's insights are displayed on separate, interactive views:

Finance View: Gross margin, net profit trends.
Sales View: Monthly sales analysis, sales channel performance.
Marketing View: Campaign effectiveness, regional insights.
Supply Chain View: Logistics cost trends, warehouse optimization.
Executive View: A summary of KPIs across departments.
